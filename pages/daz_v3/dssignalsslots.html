Signals and slots are used for communication between objects. This is a central feature of the Qt toolkit that is also available in DAZ Script (via its QtScript roots).<p>
This is an alternative to the 'callback' technique of communication that many other API's, scripting languages, and toolkits use.<p>
<b>Signals:</b> <p>
A <em>Signal</em> is emitted when a particular event occurs. You will notice that many of the DAZ Script classes have a 'Signals' section in their documentation. These are not normal functions that can be called, rather these are <em>Signals</em> that are emitted when a particular event occurs on an object of the type in question. You can listen or <em>connect</em> to these signals so that you are notified whenever the event in question occurs.<p>
<b>Slots:</b> <p>
Whenever a Signal is emitted, any <em>Slots</em> that are connected to it are executed. A <em>Slot</em> is a function that recieves the notification of a Signal. In DAZ Script, any function or class method can be a Slot.<p>
<b>Connections:</b> <p>
In order for a Signal to activate a Slot, the Slot must be <em>connected</em> to the Signal. In DAZ Script, this is done by calling one of the global <a class="el" href="group___globals.html#g22314f6f569b52e162a87a59958fd3ee">connect()</a> functions. Signals may have one or more Slots connected to them. Also, Slots may be listening (connected) to more than one Signal.<p>
Signal-Slot Connections can also be broken or <em>disconnected</em>. This happens automatically when the <a class="el" href="class_object.html" title="ECMASCript Object prototype object.">Object</a> that emits the Signal is destroyed. Similarly, if the <a class="el" href="class_object.html" title="ECMASCript Object prototype object.">Object</a> with the Slot that recieves the Signal is destroyed, the connection is automatically broken. Signal-Slot connections can also be broken programatically by calling one of the global <a class="el" href="group___globals.html#gef2052a02bf86d4b4754bda89a191157">disconnect()</a> functions. <hr size="1">
