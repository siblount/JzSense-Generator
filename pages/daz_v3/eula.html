	valid license for each such individual.</p>
	<h4>1.2 Documentation.</h4>
	<p>You may make and use an unlimited number of copies of any documentation, provided 
	that such copies shall be used only for personal purposes and are not to be 
	republished or distributed (either in hard copy or electronic form) beyond your 
	premises.</p>
	<h4>1.3 Storage/Network Use.</h4>
	<p>You may also store or install a copy of the Software on a storage device, such 
	as a network server, used only to install or run the Software on computers used

	the Software may not be shared or used concurrently by multiple end users.</p>
	<h3>2. ADDITIONAL LICENSE RIGHTS.</h3>
	<p>In addition to the rights granted in Section 1, certain portions of the Software, 
	as described in this Section 2, are provided to you with additional license 
	rights. These additional license rights are conditioned upon your compliance 
	with the distribution requirements and license restrictions described in Section 
	3.</p>
	<h4>2.1 Sample Code.</h4>
	<p>(a) DAZ3D grants you the right to: (a) use and modify the source code version 
	of those portions of the Software identified as &quot;Samples&quot; in the Software 
	(&quot;Sample Code&quot;) for the sole purposes of designing, developing, and 
	testing your software product(s), and (b) a limited, nonexclusive, royalty-free

	thereof, in object code form only. For applicable redistribution requirements 
	for Sample Code, see Section 3 below.</p>
	<p>(b) Software Sample Code is identified as all of the files in the following 
	directories on the Software CD/Download:<br>
	<br>
	<a href="../DAZScript/samples">./DAZScript/samples</a></p>
	<h4> 2.2 Redistributable Code.</h4>
	<p>DAZ3D grants you a nonexclusive, royalty-free right to reproduce and distribute 
	the object code form of any portion of the Software listed in <a href="../DAZScript/samples">
	samples</a> (&quot;Redistributable Code&quot;). For general redistribution
	requirements for Redistributable Code, see Section 3.1 below.</p>
	<h3>3. DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS AND LICENSE LIMITATIONS.</h3>
	<p>If you choose to exercise your rights under Section 2, any redistribution by 
	you is subject to your compliance with Section 3.</p>
	<h4>3.1 General Distribution Requirements.</h4>
	<p>(a) If you choose to redistribute Sample Code, or Redistributable Code (collectively, 
	the &quot;Redistributables&quot;) as described in Section 2, you agree: (i) 
	except as otherwise noted in Section 2.1 (Sample Code), to distribute the Redistributables 
	only in object code form and in conjunction with and as a part of a software 
	application product developed by you that adds significant and primary functionality 
	to the Redistributables (&quot;Licensee Software&quot;); (ii) that the Redistributables 
	only operate in conjunction with DAZ3D software; (iii) that if the Licensee 
	Software is distributed beyond Licensee's premises or externally from Licensee's 
	organization, to distribute the Licensee Software containing the Redistributables 
	pursuant to an end user license agreement (which may be &quot;break-the-seal&quot;, 
	&quot;click-wrap&quot; or signed), with terms no less protective than those 
	contained in this EULA; (iv) not to use DAZ3D's name, logo, or trademarks to 
	market the Licensee Software; (v) to display your own valid copyright notice 
	which shall be sufficient to protect DAZ3D's copyright in the Software; (vi) 
	not to remove or obscure any copyright, trademark or patent notices that appear 
	on the Software as delivered to you; (vii) to indemnify, hold harmless, and 
	defend DAZ3D from and against any claims or lawsuits, including attorney's fees, 
	that arise or result from the use or distribution of the Licensee Software; 
	(viii) to otherwise comply with the terms of this EULA; and (ix) agree that 
	DAZ3D reserves all rights not expressly granted.</p>
	<p>You also agree not to permit further distribution of the Redistributables by 
	your end users except you may permit further redistribution of the Redistributables 
	by your distributors to your end-user customers if your distributors only distribute 
	the Redistributables in conjunction with, and as part of, the Licensee Software, 
	you comply with all other terms of this EULA, and your distributors comply with 
	all restrictions of this EULA that are applicable to you.</p>
	<p>(b) If you use the Redistributables, then in addition to your compliance with 
	the applicable distribution requirements described for the Redistributables, 
	the following also applies. Your license rights to the Redistributables are 
	conditioned upon you not (i) creating derivative works of the Redistributables 
	in any manner that would cause the Redistributables in whole or in part to become 
	subject to any of the terms of an Excluded License; or (ii) distributing the 
	Redistributables (or derivative works thereof) in any manner that would cause 
	the Redistributables to become subject to any of the terms of an Excluded License. 
	An &quot;Excluded License&quot; is any license that requires as a condition 
	of use, modification and/or distribution of software subject to the Excluded 
	License, that such software or other software combined and/or distributed with 
	such software be (x) disclosed or distributed in source code form; (y) licensed 
	for the purpose of making derivative works; or (z) redistributable at no charge.</p>
