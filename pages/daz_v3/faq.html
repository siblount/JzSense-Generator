<h1><a class="anchor" name="faq">DAZ Script Frequently Asked Questions</a></h1><ul>
<li><b>Why does my RSL shader not render? I've followed the shader swapping samples...</b><br>
<br>
 Provided your shader doesn't contain errors that would prevent it from compiling, the renderer needs the shaders to be compiled (for that version of the renderer) before it can use them. This can be done a few different ways, but the easiest by far is to use the RSL Shader Compiler plugin included with the DAZ Script Development Kit. The plugin can be accessed via the "<em>Compile RenderMan Shader...</em>" action, which by default is located in the Option Menu for the Surfaces tab.</li></ul>

<li><b>What coordinate system does DAZ Studio use?</b><br>
<br>
 Three dimensional coordinate systems come in two flavors, <em>right-handed</em> and <em>left-handed</em>. The difference between the two is based on the direction that the axes point in relation to one another. To help visualize this, we use three fingers on either hand to represent the <em>positive</em> direction for each of the axes. For both hands, we'll use the thumb to indicate the positive X axis, the index finger to indicate the positive Y axis, and the middle finger to indicate the positive Z axis.<br>
<br>
 If you hold up your left hand, with your thumb ponting to the right and your index finger pointing up (like a capital letter L), extending your middle finger so that it is perpendicular to your palm, we see that the positive Z axis points away from you. This is the left-handed coordinate system.<br>
<br>
 If you do the same thing with your right hand, in order to point your thumb along the positive X axis (to the right) you have to rotate your hand so that your palm is facing you. With your middle finger extended perpendicular to your palm, we see that the positive Z axis points toward you. This is the right-handed coordinate system, and the one that DAZ Studio uses. </li></ul>
